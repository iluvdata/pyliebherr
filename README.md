# PyLiebherr:  Access the Smart Home Device API Library

![PyPI - Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/pyliebherr)

Python library to access the [Liebherr Smart Home API](https://developer.liebherr.com/apis/smartdevice-homeapi/) (account required).

## Changelog

### 2025.11.4 ➡️ 2026.1.1

* Controls are now mapped by type, zone_id, and device.  This optimizes the number of cpu cycles that Home Assistant will have to perform to find the control (no more looping through controls until the corresponding control is found).
* Fixed the case of some constant variables for consistency.

### 2026.1.2

* Controls mapping had to change to by `control_name` then `zone_id` if applicable.

### 2026.1.3

* Fixed a duplicate debug log issue.

### 2026.5.0

* Add support to using the server-sent events endpoint negating the need to poll.

### 2026.5.1

* Poll only the temperature controls (API temp unit mismatch workaround).

### 2026.6.1

* Added better error trapping and callbacks for SSE connection errors.

### 2026.6.5

* SSE Cancellation error fix
* Add support for temperature steps
* Default to grabbing controls from REST API as SSE initial event often incomplete or inconsistent
* Remove temperature unit mismatch work around now the API is fixed.

### 2026.6.6

* Switch back to SSE only as pushed controls now appear complete
